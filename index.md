## Features


### Highly ergonomic
Voice search is faster and far more ergonomic than typing. This speed and convenience is critical since we spend the bulk of our browsing hours "Searching".

### Better queries -> Better Results
Voice queries are more natural than text queries and today's AI models are better at answering voice queries than a bunch of typed keywords. For example, people are more likely to say "How tall is Obama?" while more likely to type "Obama height".

### Fewer Tabs, Improved Productivity.
With Audate, search results can be displayed in a Preview pane in the same tab. The preview pane is interactive and functions like an Assistant in a browsing context.

### Privacy Friendly
No need to open new incognito tab to avoid an off query poluting your search history, Audate previews happen in a different browser context that would not appear in your browsing history or Google search history.

We do not store your voice queries anywhere, not even in the browser. The source code is open-source to preserve this guarantee - github.com/AudateApp.

### High customizable
Audate supports all popular search engines Google, Bing, Baidu, Yahoo!, Yandex, DuckDuckGo, and Ecosia and voice search is available in over 200 languages!

### State of the Art AI
Audate relies on state of the art AI to ensure your queries are transcribed correctly for the given locale.  It can filter out your voice from background music, detect when you're done speaking and automatically begin search and a whole lot more.

### It's Free
There is no cost to using this product and there will never be. I built this to improve my search productivity, and figured others might find it useful as well.
